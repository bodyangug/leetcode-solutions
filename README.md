# LeetCode Solutions Project

- [Generated docs](https://deepwiki.com/bodyangug/leetcode-solutions)

## Project Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions for various problems from LeetCode. LeetCode is a platform for learning
and improving coding skills with a focus on problem-solving.

## Project Structure

Each problem has its own class, which contains the solution code and a reference link to problem.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the solutions and use them as a reference. Please note that while these solutions work, they
may not be the most efficient or optimal. Always strive to improve and find the best solution possible.

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal project, contributions are welcome. If you have a more efficient solution or a
solution to a problem that is not yet in the repository, feel free to create a pull request.

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. Please do not use it to cheat on LeetCode problems. Always try to solve
the problem on your own before looking at the solutions.
